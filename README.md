# javascript-consolidation
Repo for redoing the Javascript introductory exercises.

The goal is to redo the exercises with as little online assistance as possible for better understanding.

exercise 1 : easy, no issues

exercise 2 : easy, but confusion with 
let name = prompt("What is your name?");    
Not easy for me to understand the value here is the input from the user, not just the prompt message.
had to remove 1 line of prompts or I'd have double prompts

exercise 3 : no issues, solved with a simple if else. Only confusion was thinking I need a function
when using conditional statements, which apparently isn't the case.

exercise 4 : part 1 and 2 were solved easily, but rerunning the process was hard without looking it up.
didnt remember while loop and couldnt break the rerunning loop, had to look up the answer sadly.
